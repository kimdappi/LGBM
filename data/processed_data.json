There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax. Focus of air seen under the right hemidiaphragm, likely represents colonic interposition.  IMPRESSION:No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  ___ RUE U/S: IMPRESSION: 4 cm acute deep vein thrombosis noted within the mid right brachial vein as detailed above. ___ CXR: IMPRESSION: The endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube tip is beyond the GE junction and off the edge of the film.  A left central line is present in the tip is in the mid SVC.  A pacemaker is noted on the right in the lead projects over the right ventricle.  There is probable scarring in both lung apices.  There are no new areas of consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution and cardiomegaly suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension. There is no pneumothorax.  Brief Hospital Course:___ hx severe COPD, AFib, CAD, HTN, HLD, recent hospitalizations for recurrent COPD exacerbations over the last several months, who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to severe COPD. She was treated for her COPD with nebulizers and steroids, but continued to decline eventually suffering a PEA arrest thought due to hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A temporary pacemaker was placed for periods of bradycardia that may also have contributed to her PEA arrest (versus being a manifestation of severe hypoxemia/severe hypercarbia preceding her arrest). She made a cognitive recovery but was unable to be successfully weaned from her ventilator. She had capacity and was able to make it understand that she did not wish: continued intubation & mechanical ventilation; re-intubation and mechanical ventilation once extubated; or, positive non-invasive pressure ventilation. After extensive discussions with her and her family, she was transitioned to DNR/DNI and comfort-oriented care. She was extubated to spend quality time with her family before passing from respiratory failure on the morning of ___ at 0515. Autopsy was declined by family.She was incidentally found to have a RUE DVT that was treated with heparin gtt (which was also used for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation; she was temporarily transitioned to argatroban for concern of HIT, but PF4 antibodies returned at very low OD, making this diagnosis unlikely). She was also treated for an acute sinusitis with Augmentin during her hospital stay.  Medications on Admission:The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.1.

ACUTE ISSUES:=============# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient presented with weight loss for several months with anemia and abdominal pain. Patient without prior preventative health care. Imaging from outside hospital demonstrated rectosigmoid mass with metastases to the liver and lungs. Patient underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy demonstrating adenocarcinoma. Given near complete obstruction Advanced Endoscopy placed a palliative stent. He developed diffuse abdominal pain on ___ CT abd showed colonic stent perforation. He was not deemed a surgical candidate due to his widely metastatic disease. He wished to become CMO/DNR/DNI, and expired peacefully on ___. Family was notified and declined autopsy. # Abdominal Stent Perforation: Experienced diffuse abdominal pain on ___, CT abdomen showed perforation ___ stent.  He was not felt to be a good surgical candidate due to metastatic cancer and poor functional status. He wished to become CMO. Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole were prescribed to improve his abdominal pain and discomfort. # Hyponatremia, chronic: Patient presented with sodium of 118 at outside hospital The patient was given IV fluids until stable sodium level reached at 127. SIADH was thought to be a significant component of his hyponatremia, given his extensive metastatic disease to his lungs.# Septicemia: Met sepsis criteria on ___. Thought to be due to either hospital-associated pneumonia or GI translocation in the setting of stent perforation. He was treated with antibiotics until his family was able to visit, then discontinued.# Hospital-Associated Pneumonia: He developed increased sputum production and shortness of breath, and a chest x-ray was suggestive of right lower lobe pneumonia. He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.CHRONIC ISSUES:===============# Microcytic anemia: Patient found to have anemia with MCV 79. Iron studies demonstrated anemia of chronic disease and also likely iron deficient in setting of chronic bleeding from GI malignancy. He was started on iron supplementation.# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to metastatic liver involvement vs. EtOH use given elevated AST:ALT ratio.# Alcohol abuse: Patient reports chronic use of alcohol, multiple beers and at least two shots of brandy daily. Has continued to drink despite lack of appetite prior to hospitalization. During his admission, he had no evidence of withdrawal.# Melena: Patient had melena after stent placement. Sigmoidoscopy on ___ showed tumor infiltration into the stent with friable, bleeding tissue, which was the likely source of his bleeding.# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril in the setting of low blood pressures.# Hepatitis C: untreated.

Brief Hospital Course:SUMMARY:========___ w/ hx of HLD, CAD c/b remote anteroseptal MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy HFrEF (EF=27%) mild/mod MR/TR, CKD, and permanent afib w/ CHB s/p BiV ICD who presented with respiratory distress, found to be in cardiogenic shock c/b possible demand STEMI. He was intubated shortly after arrival to the ED for respiratory distress. While he was in the ED, his rhythm changed from sinus to a narrow complex tachycardia and ST segment elevations developed over the course of an hour on serial EKGs. He also had polymorphic VT during this time for which amiodarone drip was initiated. Code STEMI was called, he was given ASA and ticagrelor load and he was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have 95% distal LM disease, 100% ___ LAD stenosis with collateralization from RCA distribution, 40% ___, and 70% ostial RCA disease. No intervention was performed due to complexity and unclear goals of care; and impella CP was placed through right femoral access while heparin drip initiated; a Swan-ganz catheter was placed in the R femoral vein, and later on an A-line was placed in the right arm. Goals of care discussion was held, as the patient was previously DNR/DNI and PCI would put him at high risk for needing dialysis given his CKD; there was concern this would not be consistent with his goals as someone who preferred to avoid being in the hospital. The recovery process would additionally likely necessitate a long rehab stint. Meanwhile, he was treated broadly with vancomycin and Cefepime for fever, likely secondary to lung source. Due to his Impella he developed complications of hemolysis and hyperkalemia, so was temporized with IV insulin and dextrose. He was not making significant urine so Lasix was a poor option and dialysis was not within goals of care. Repeat family meeting was held discussing CPR, and it was decided that this would be against the patient's wishes. At that time, patient was made DNR and ICD was disabled. HCP wished to continue with medical management including impella and ventilator support until family was able to visit the patient. Overnight on ___, patient had increasingly downtrending MAPs and began alarming for low flow on the impella. Exam at that point in time was notable for R surgical pupil, L fixed dilated pupil, no corneal reflex, no gag or cough reflex, no withdraw to painful stimuli. Cardiac exam with very faint S1/S2 with weak carotid pulses. Patient was triggering spontaneous breaths on ventilator. Upon discussion with family at that time, the preference was to wait to discontinue life support until arrival of the daughter. After that conversation, patient then developed loss of all arterial pulsations on A-line and lost his pulse on exam. He also was noted to be asystolic on telemetry so all supportive measures were withdrawn. He was pronounced disease at 0405 on ___. Family members were immediately contacted and came to bedside. His HCP declined autopsy.  Medications on Admission:The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires futher investigation.1. Mirtazapine 45 mg PO QHS 2. Allopurinol ___ mg PO DAILY 3.

Patient underwent ___ minutes of CPR (no epi or defibrillation per ED report) before ROSC was achieved. Initial rhythm during the event is unclear. Of note, she was in dialysis for 1 hour and only 140 cc were removed prior to event. Patient was subsequently transferred to ___ where she was started on heparin gtt for possible NSTEMI given ST depressions on EKG and initial troponin of 0.08. While at A-J, SBP dropped to 35 and patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation. 12-lead EKG showed a left bundle branch block, which she is known to have and occurs intermittently. Patient was subsequently cardioverted and received 2 L NS and IV digoxin, prior to returning to NSR At A-J, she underwent CT angiogram which did not show aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus. Patient was awake and talking and denied CP or SOB, though she endorsed significant ongoing back pain, which has been a chronic issue. BP subsequently improved with initiation of Levophed. Cardiology was consulted due to concern for posterior STEMI given EKG findings; posterior MI was felt to be unlikely and ischemic findings were thought to be ___ hypotension and severe AS. She was subsequently transferred to ___ for CVVHD and further management.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She endorses back pain. She endorses dyspnea on exertion prior to HD sessions, which is relieved following HD. Otherwise review of systems was negative.In the ED initial vitals were:  HR 82 BP 84/42 RR21 95% Nasal Cannula Labs/studies notable for: BNP >32000, Troponin 0.74, MB 136, WBC 18.9, H/H ___, Lactate 2.8, Cr 6.6, ALT 64, AST 119CXR with marked enlargement of the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting severe pulmonary edema, underlying pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion not excluded.

Moderate three vessel CAD.2. Preserved cardiac ouput.3. Elevated left sided filling pressure with prominent V waves.ECHO:The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 25%) secondary to akinesis of the inferior wall, hypokinesis of the posterior wall, and pacing-induced dyssynchrony. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 0.5 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

No previous tracing available for comparison.  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)An 8 mm hyperdensity is seen in the cerebellum on the left, likely representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage or possibly a hyperdense lesion such as a vascular malformation which is considered less likely. Mild surrounding hypodensity is seen suggesting edema without significant mass effect.  There is no evidence of mass effect, or infarction.  Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age related involutional changes or atrophy.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of gray-white matter differentiation.    No fracture is identified.  Visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are intact.     IMPRESSION:  Focus of hyperdensity in the cerebellum on the left, likely representing an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, less likely a hyperdense lesion such as a vascular malformation.  Recommend followup imaging to ensure expected evolution. CT C-SPINE (___)1. Degenerative changes without cervical spine fracture or subluxation.    2. Hyperdensity within the cerebellum is better characterized on dedicated head CT.   CXR (___)No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.   FEMUR (___)Displaced right intertrochanteric femoral neck fracture.  No dislocation.ECHO (___)The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal-distal anterior septum. The LV apex was not well seen (possibly hypokinetic). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new. Pulmonary pressures are higher. Other findings are similar.  LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO (___)Images from the operating suite show placement of fixation device about the fracture of the proximal right femur.  Further information can be gathered from the operative report.   KNEE XRAY (___)There is moderate right knee joint effusion.  There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.  The knee joint spaces are relatively preserved.  On the AP view, there is some periosteal thickening along the lateral aspect of the distal femoral metaphysis.  This may be due to prior old trauma.  Alternatively, the patient has lung pathology, this may represent hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___)1.  Stable right cerebellar hemispheric hyperdense focus, with surrounding ring of vasogenic edema.     These findings are concerning for underlying malignancy, although they may also be compatible with parenchymal contusion or primary (hypertensive) hemorrhage.  Enhanced MRI could be considered for further characterization of the lesion.     2.  No evidence of new hemorrhage or large territorial infarction.   3.  Age related atrophic changes and evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.   Brief Hospital Course:___ with PMH significant for prior left thalamic ischemic CVA in ___ with residual aphasia presented s/p fall 4 days prior to admission. OSH imaging concerning for a cerebellar hemorrhage. Initial hospital course as below.On the night of ___  he was found to have vomited copious coffee ground emesis, his O2 sat was 75% on RA, and he was in acute respiratory distress.  Small amounts of coffee grounds were suctioned from his airway, and his SpO2 improved to low ___ on a non-rebreather mask but could not be weaned.  Lactate found to be 4.3, VBG 7.27/49/70 and ABG 7.37/41/75.  CXR showed a new infiltrate in RLL consistent with likely aspiration event as well as dilated loops of bowel. Gastroccult was positive so a PPI bolus + drip was started.  Family was called and after discussion with his health care providers regarding his clinical circumstances, the decision was made to change his code status to DNR/DNI and he was transferred to the MICU for further care. On arrival to the MICU, a goals of care discussion was held with the family and the decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only. The family was in accordance with this plan and all of their questions regarding his clinical circumstances were answered. He was placed on a morphine drip for comfort. Time of death was 8:05am on ___. Organ bank was notifed, but declined donation. The family declined autopsy, and while saddened by his death, they endorsed appreciation of the medical care he had received while at ___. ========================================# Cerebellar hemorrhage:The patient was evaluated by neurology and neurosurgery, who felt the cerebellar hemorrhage was likely due to spontaneous bleed rather than a contusion. The hemorrhage also appears to be non-acute. The patient did not have any indications for neurosurgical intervention as imaging did not reveal mass effect or midline shift. Furthermore, the patient's neurologic examination remained stable. Aspirin was discontinued in setting of spontaneous bleed. # S/p right trochanteric fracture:Patient s/p trochanteric fixation on ___ without complications. The patient's pain was initially managed with morphine, however this was later discontinued as he developed urinary retention. The patient's pain was controlled with standing tylenol. # Acute kidney injury:Cr on admission 2.9, baseline 1.1-1.3. Etiology likely pre-renal as patient had poor PO intake prior to admission. NSAIDs may have contributed as well. # Hypernatremia:Likely secondary to hypovolemia as patient had poor PO intake. Hypernatemia corrected with IVF.# UTI:Urinalysis with pyuria and bacteriuria. The patient was started on ciprofloxacin, but this was discontinued on day 3 when cultures returned negative.# Acute urinary retention:Patient has a history of urinary incontinence. Etiology of acute urinary retention thought to be secondary to post-operative urinary retention due to opioid use. A foley was placed and opioids discontinued. The patient failed a voiding trial x 3. # Normocytic anemia:Patient presented with normocytic anemia. He required 2 units of RBCs during this admission. Iron studies were done after the patient received the transfusions. The patient was started on ferrous sulfate. - Health care proxy ___.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on ___.# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. # Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored.# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in-house and at discharge.CHRONIC ISSUES==============# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were continued in-house and at discharge.  # COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued in-house and at discharge.TRANSITIONAL ISSUES===================[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have biweekly BMPs (script written).

Discharge Instructions:Dear Ms. ___,It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.We wish you all the best!Your ___ care team Followup Instructions:___"

The lungs are adequately aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. ___ ECHOThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation.  Brief Hospital Course:Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.#Epistaxis, nasal fracturesPatient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. #NSTEMIPatient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidationPatient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.#Acute kidney injuryPatient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.#Peripheral vascular diseasePatient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.TRANSITIONAL ISSUES-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease (possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). -Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR.-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.-Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL infiltrative process.-Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later evaluation of nasal fractures.-Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and platelets.-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for ease-of-administration.
